# React three fiber template 

This project was created to enable you to create POC a little quicker, I've included the @react-three-fiber package alongwith three.js 

# Launch project

To open this project in your localhost run the command yarn start
I added a killall -9 node function into the start command so when you launch this project it will terminiate any other localhosts you have running.
